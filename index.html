      <h2>Birds</h2>
      <p>
        Birds (Aves) are a group of vertebrates which evolved from dinosaurs.
        They are endothermic, with feathers. Modern birds are toothless: they
        have beaked jaws. They lay hard-shelled eggs. They have a high metabolic
        rate, a four-chambered heart and a strong yet lightweight skeleton.
        Birds live all over the world. They range in size from the 5 cm (2 in)
        bee hummingbird to the 2.70 m (9 ft) ostrich. They are the class of
        tetrapods with the most living species: about ten thousand. More than
        half of these are passerines, sometimes known as perching birds. Birds
        are the closest living relatives of the Crocodilia.

        The fossil record shows that birds evolved from feathered theropod
        dinosaurs. Modern birds are not descended from Archaeopteryx. According
        to DNA evidence, modern birds (Neornithes) evolved in the Middle to
        Upper Cretaceous. More recent estimates, using a new way of calibrating
        molecular clocks, showed that modern birds originated early in the Upper
        Cretaceous. However, diversification occurred around the
        Cretaceous–Palaeogene extinction event.

        The Cretaceous–Palaeogene extinction event 66 million years ago killed
        off all the non-avian dinosaur lines. Birds, especially those in the
        southern continents, survived this event and then migrated to other
        parts of the world. Primitive bird-like dinosaurs are in the broader
        group Avialae.
